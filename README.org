* emacs.london

This is the source for https://emacs.london, the website for the Emacs London
meetup.

It's hosted on Github Pages, so any changes that are merged into master will
automatically go live.

** Building the site

The source is in org-mode. So far it is compiled by exporting individual pages
to html using ~C-c C-e h h~, and committing the exported HTML. This has worked OK
so far but can be awkward if people have different export variables
configured. The workflow will be a bit nicer if we configure a specific org
publish project - that will hopefully be updated soon.
