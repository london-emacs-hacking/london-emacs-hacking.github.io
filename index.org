#+TITLE: Emacs London
#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: ./index.html

* welcome!

This website provides information and resources for the Emacs London meetup. We
welcome anyone who is interested in Emacs:

- if you use the defaults, spacemacs, doom, evil or anything else
- if you're a text editor or lisp geek, a programmer, writer, academic, or even [[https://bofh.org.uk/2019/02/25/baking-with-emacs/][baker]]
- whether you discovered Emacs last week or in 1976

We try to meet every month in a central place in London. We usually do not have
speakers, because we find a lot of the fun is in interacting with other Emacs
users (and it makes it a bit easier to organise).

There have been many meetups over the years in London, and a lot of people from
the community have contributed. Currently it is organised by
[[https://github.com/qazwsxpawel][Pawel]] and
[[https://github.com/mattduck][Matt]]. If you'd like to get involved, speak, or
just have questions, you can contact us on:

- [[https://www.meetup.com/London-Emacs-Hacking/][meetup.com]]
- The [[https://emacs-london.herokuapp.com/][emacs-london Slack]]
- or via [[mailto:hi@mattduck.com][email]].
