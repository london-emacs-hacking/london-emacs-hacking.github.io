* About

  /You can often use Emacs to help you understand what puzzles you or to find out how to do something new./
  /This self-reliance is not only a pleasure, but an advantage./
  /--Emacs Lisp Intro Info pages/

  Your friendly local Emacs User Group and useful resources about Emacs!
  Open to all persuasions--emacs, spacemacs, doom etc.
  Open to all text editor & lisp geeks--programmers, writers, [[https://bofh.org.uk/2019/02/25/baking-with-emacs/][bakers]].
  Meant to be a regular meetup--a beginner vs. advanced topics and talks vs. hands on sessions (config, elisp, new packages, new ideas in emacs etc.).
  For pre- and post- meetup discussions and all other things Emacs check out [[https://emacs-london.slack.com][slack]]
