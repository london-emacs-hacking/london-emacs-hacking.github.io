* Next meetup: Monday July 29th 7pm, Poetry Society Studio

The next Emacs London meetup is scheduled for Monday July 29th. The meetup will
be a hands-on Dojo-style session, hosted at the [[https://goo.gl/maps/hQTo4moTHToJwvgG7][Poetry Society Studio]] in
Holborn, with optional drinks at [[https://goo.gl/maps/AVqtkDoeoDtRmwZV9][Cittie of York]] afterwards.

We will split into small groups/pairs, chat & work on Emacs-related things.
Food & drink will be available to purchase at the caf√© downstairs.

We will kick off properly at 7pm but attendees are welcome from 6pm.

Going forwards we will meet monthly (exact dates and venue TBC). The format will be
simple: we may have unplanned/informal presentations or
coding/demos, or we might just talk over drink and food. To break it up a little
we will want to do some longer, invited talks every now and then.

You must sign up to the guestlist on [[https://www.meetup.com/London-Emacs-Hacking/][meetup.com]] to attend. For questions and
other Emacs conversation join the new [[https://emacs-london.herokuapp.com/][emacs-london Slack]].

See you there!
